# printFlashcards

This is a tool that transforms a comma separated (CSV) list of flashcard data into a display to be printed on to the front and back of cardstock which is then to be cut into individual flashcards.

To use it, visit https://dc25.github.io/printFlashcards and click to "Choose File" button to load a CSV flashcard file from your hard disk.  The printable output will display immediatly.  You should be able to print directly to your printer.   *Important* : Set the printer margins to "none" and (of course) print to the front and back of each page.

Tested on a Brother 2270-DW printer.
